// This diff-sequences package implements the linear space variation in
// An O(ND) Difference Algorithm and Its Variations by Eugene W. Myers

// Relationship in notation between Myers paper and this package:
// A is a
// N is aLength, aEnd - aStart, and so on
// x is aIndex, aFirst, aLast, and so on
// B is b
// M is bLength, bEnd - bStart, and so on
// y is bIndex, bFirst, bLast, and so on
// Δ = N - M is negative of baDeltaLength = bLength - aLength
// D is d
// k is kF
// k + Δ is kF = kR - baDeltaLength
// V is aIndexesF or aIndexesR (see comment below about Indexes type)
// index intervals [1, N] and [1, M] are [0, aLength) and [0, bLength)
// starting point in forward direction (0, 0) is (-1, -1)
// starting point in reverse direction (N + 1, M + 1) is (aLength, bLength)

// The “edit graph” for sequences a and b corresponds to items:
// in a on the horizontal axis
// in b on the vertical axis
//
// Given a-coordinate of a point in a diagonal, you can compute b-coordinate.
//
// Forward diagonals kF:
// zero diagonal intersects top left corner
// positive diagonals intersect top edge
// negative diagonals insersect left edge
//
// Reverse diagonals kR:
// zero diagonal intersects bottom right corner
// positive diagonals intersect right edge
// negative diagonals intersect bottom edge

// The graph contains a directed acyclic graph of edges:
// horizontal: delete an item from a
// vertical: insert an item from b
// diagonal: common item in a and b
//
// The algorithm solves dual problems in the graph analogy:
// Find longest common subsequence: path with maximum number of diagonal edges
// Find shortest edit script: path with minimum number of non-diagonal edges

// Input callback function compares items at indexes in the sequences.

// Output callback function receives the number of adjacent items
// and starting indexes of each common subsequence.
// Either original functions or wrapped to swap indexes if graph is transposed.
// Indexes in sequence a of last point of forward or reverse paths in graph.
// Myers algorithm indexes by diagonal k which for negative is bad deopt in V8.
// This package indexes by iF and iR which are greater than or equal to zero.
// and also updates the index arrays in place to cut memory in half.
// kF = 2 * iF - d
// kR = d - 2 * iR
// Division of index intervals in sequences a and b at the middle change.
// Invariant: intervals do not have common items at the start or end.
const pkg = 'diff-sequences'; // for error messages
const NOT_YET_SET = 0; // small int instead of undefined to avoid deopt in V8

// Return the number of common items that follow in forward direction.
// The length of what Myers paper calls a “snake” in a forward path.
